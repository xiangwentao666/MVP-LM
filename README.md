# Code-related
The source code of the shell script required to run the code contains many personalized logic elements, aiming to improve efficiency, establish a standard operating procedure (SOP) for each execution, and automate the model training and inference process. You may extract the most essential command for launching the Python process and incorporate your own automation logic as needed.
